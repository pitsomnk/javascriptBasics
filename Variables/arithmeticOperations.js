// Arithmetic   
// Operations:  
// 1. Declare two variables ‘num1’ and ‘num2’ and assign them any two 
// numbers.  
// 2. Declare variables to store the sum, difference, product,  and quotient of 
// num1 and num2.  
// 3. Print the results of these arithmetic operations.  


let num1 =247
let num2 =300

sum=num1+num2
difference=num1-num2
product=num1*num2
quotient=num1/num2

console.log('The Sum is :', sum,'The difference is :',difference,'The product is :','The product is :',product,'The quotient is :',quotient)
